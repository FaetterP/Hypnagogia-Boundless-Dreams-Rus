Every one of us you see has been made to be disposable.\r\nRejected: It looks as though you've been added to the proverbial pile as well.\r\nRejected: There is nothing down here but old memories. Remnants of dreams long forgotten. [event=4]\r\nRejected: Someone is waiting for you far beyond this point. Go now or become one of us.\r\n[title=reject_1_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 2\r\n[title=reject_2_begin]\r\nRejected: I see a view so vast and full of potential yet everything feels so empty and neglected.\r\nRejected: We yearned for something greater but like the scenery, maybe our dreams got a little too cloudy.\r\nRejected: [question=00]It doesn't have to be like this, but no one ever tries to stop it. What do you think?\r\n[choice]It's pointless.[newtalk start=answer_reject_2_no_begin break=answer_reject_2_no_end]\r\n[choice]It's possible.[newtalk start=answer_reject_2_yes_begin break=answer_reject_2_yes_end]\r\n[title=reject_2_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 2 CHOICE 1\r\n[title=answer_reject_2_no_begin]\r\nRejected: You're right. It's nothing but a cold, black, empty ocean of indifference and we're all drowning in it.\r\nRejected: Maybe it's meant to stay the way it is for a reason. The universe will always do what it wants. Benefits of living in such a pitiful microcosm.\r\n[title=answer_reject_2_no_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 2 CHOICE 2\r\n[title=answer_reject_2_yes_begin]\r\nRejected: High hopes for a person in a place like this. Your words may one day be an inspiration to someone.\r\nRejected: Or maybe you're a fool. Optimism, enthusiasm, happiness... they all died a long time ago.\r\n[title=answer_reject_2_yes_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 3-1\r\n[title=reject_3-1_begin]\r\nRejected: I've lost track of time so long ago, but I still see the occasional blur of someone pass me by.\r\nRejected: As I sit here I think to myself, how did I end up here? What choices did I make that led me to this exact spot?\r\nRejected: I've vainly tried for years to make the right moves to plan the rest of my life, while being keenly aware there's bleak chance for a brighter future.\r\nRejected: Maybe I'll figure it out someday. Probably not. Who can say.\r\n[title=reject_3-1_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 3\r\n[title=reject_3_begin]\r\nRejected: Something to eat... something to eat... anything to eat... anything...\r\nRejected: Piles of trash... globs of garbage... old useless rubbish...\r\n[title=reject_3_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 4\r\n[title=reject_4_begin]\r\nRejected: I lay here every hour of every day hoping to finally close my eyes and wake up to see a different place.\r\nRejected: The ground is cold and hard, but the endless burning rubble at least keeps my back warm.\r\n[title=reject_4_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 5\r\n[title=reject_5_begin]\r\nRejected: I once had a dream that everything in the world was rearranged, slightly shifted somehow.\r\nRejected: It may have only been a few inches or a few feet, but everyone was happier because of it.\r\nRejected: I think whatever possibilities of that dream coming true have now ended up here.\r\nRejected: I will spend the rest of eternity trying to find them again, and so will you.\r\n[title=reject_5_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 6\r\n[title=reject_6_begin]\r\nRejected: I've been here for longer than I can remember, and I've never been to the second tower.\r\nRejected: I can go any time I want, any of us can, but with every step my body moves slower and slower.\r\nRejected: [question=01]It takes days for me to get to even the nearest of places. I think I'll just continue to rest here.\r\n[choice]Good idea.[newtalk start=answer_reject_6_no_begin break=answer_reject_6_no_end]\r\n[choice]Keep trying.[newtalk start=answer_reject_6_yes_begin break=answer_reject_6_yes_end]\r\n[title=reject_6_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 6 CHOICE 1\r\n[title=answer_reject_6_no_begin]\r\nRejected: Yes... resting is good. Just... sitting... here. So easy... comfortable.\r\n[title=answer_reject_6_no_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 6 CHOICE 2\r\n[title=answer_reject_6_yes_begin]\r\nRejected: No... I don't know... Everyone I know wants to stay, maybe I should too. I'll think about this.\r\n[title=answer_reject_6_yes_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 7\r\n[title=reject_7_begin]\r\nRejected: It was so blissful keeping my eyes blinded to the world around me, before I was forcibly brought into it.\r\nRejected: The hubris it must take to yank a soul out of non-existence, into this, meat. And to force a life into this thresher.\r\nRejected: My mind keeps at a stand-still holding a level of comprehension that will never be enough. I want to go back.\r\n[title=reject_7_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 8\r\n[title=reject_8_begin]\r\nRejected: Could there really be nothing left up ahead? More of the same, more repetition. It's not... I can't believe that. \r\nRejected: There's got to be more to discover out there than just this. I can't keep doing this. It hurts so much.\r\nRejected: [question=02]What could I be doing wrong?\r\n[choice]Everything.[newtalk start=answer_reject_8_no_begin break=answer_reject_8_no_end]\r\n[choice]Keep going.[newtalk start=answer_reject_8_yes_begin break=answer_reject_8_yes_end]\r\n[title=reject_8_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 8 CHOICE 1\r\n[title=answer_reject_8_no_begin]\r\nRejected: That can't be right... I've only used what I learned, what I've experienced...\r\nRejected: If it's all wrong, I... I don't where else to turn. I need to really think hard about this.\r\n[title=answer_reject_8_no_end]\r\n\r\nGOBLIN 8 CHOICE 2\r\n[title=answer_reject_8_yes_begin]\r\nRejected: Do you... really believe? I can... I will. Months, years, decades in the making but I will get to where I want.\r\nRejected: Thank... you for saying that.\r\n[title=answer_reject_8_yes_end]\r\n\r\nBABY CUBE ANGELS\r\n\r\nGatekeeper LOWER\r\n[title=Gatekeeper_0_begin]\r\nGatekeeper: The outlier approaches.

Before you stand <color=#e0d33f><b>three pillars</b></color> of your own creation.\r\nGatekeeper: An exit exists somewhere in this dream, but for you and you alone. It calls to you.\r\nGatekeeper: [question=0]Do you stay or continue?

It has been here since time began, and in your possession it will complete your journey.\r\n???: [question=4]I will answer any questions you may have, should you so desire an answer.\r\n[choice]What are you?[newtalk start=answer_angel_1_begin break=answer_angel_1_end]\r\n[choice]What do I seek?[newtalk start=answer_angel_2_begin break=answer_angel_2_end]\r\n[choice]Where is Gogi?[newtalk start=answer_angel_3_begin break=answer_angel_3_end]\r\n[choice]...[newtalk start=answer_angel_4_begin break=answer_angel_4_end]\r\n[title=angel_big_0_end]\r\n\r\nANGEL CHOICE 1\r\n[title=answer_angel_1_begin]\r\n???: I am many things.
