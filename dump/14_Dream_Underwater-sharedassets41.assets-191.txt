Aye, it's no worry, lovely.\r\nEden: [question=7]However, you're still a bit of a stranger, and I want to know you a little more a'course.

Aye, what a world we'd be in if something so comfortable was made so available to us.\r\nEden: It's a rare pleasure to feel content with so many constant whirlpools at your feet. Life's not quite as exciting without them I say.[newtalk start=eel_right0_begin break=eel_right0_end]\r\n[title=eden_content_end]\r\n\r\n[title=eden_loved_begin]\r\nEden: To be <b>loved</b>, you say? Ooh, bless your broken bonnie heart. Never worry yourself to such a fragile state. Not good for the health, now is it?\r\nEden: We are all loved, and especially you. But do ya love yourself? Only you can answer that.[newtalk start=eel_right0_begin break=eel_right0_end]\r\n[title=eden_loved_end]\r\n\r\n[title=eden_praised_begin]\r\nEden: To be <b>praised</b>, that is? Well- isn't that just the problem with people today? Believing themselves to be left without praise.\r\nEden: Nevermind keeping so occupied on something as praise, but rather the work it takes to it. You will appreciate yourself for doing such.[newtalk start=eel_right0_begin break=eel_right0_end]\r\n[title=eden_praised_end]\r\n\r\n[title=eel_right0_begin]\r\nEden: [question=9]Another question for yae, wee child.

A fear that not one living soul can deny is of great sincerity.\r\nEden: To respect the unexplored is to deny it a place to be feared. Do not falter when you walk strongly into it, and it will return you an equal respect.[newtalk start=eel_win_begin break=eel_win_end]\r\n[title=eden_unknown_end]\r\n\r\n[title=eden_world_begin]\r\nEden: The unpredictable <b>world</b>. Within it there are many things to be afraid of, but altogether it echoes those same fears a million times more.\r\nEden: Once a pattern is learned, it changes once again. Consistency is the key to defeating the fear. The world won't bother learning from you, so why not learn from it?[newtalk start=eel_win_begin break=eel_win_end]\r\n[title=eden_world_end]\r\n\r\n[title=eden_truth_begin]\r\nEden: The ineffable <b>truth</b>. A balance of words which can bring love and hope, or pain and suffering.\r\nEden: Unlike time, it is a nebulous, infinitely changing sphere. It contracts in size when we face the truth inside, and expands outwards when it is best left unspoken.[newtalk start=eel_win_begin break=eel_win_end]\r\n[title=eden_truth_end]\r\n\r\n[title=eel_win_begin]\r\nEden: Oh joy, what an interesting one you've been. Thank you for spending your time with an old sea lass. A friendly blether is hard to find in such lonely waters.\r\nEden: My <color=#fcbe2b><b>treasure</b></color> is yours. I've always likened more to the chest itself than the trinket anywho, so it's not a bother.\r\nEden: Hark, traveler- this temple is not one of solitude nor of tranquility. An evil lives deeper in these waters which has been forever locked away.\r\nEden: You would do wise to remain within the safety of the shallows. Farewell, and take care.[event=8]\r\n[title=eel_win_end]\r\n\r\nTREASURE CHEST OPEN\r\n\r\n[title=chest_open_begin]\r\nThe previously closed chest is now open. There's a strange but familiar <color=#f54242><b>red cube</b></color> inside. \\nYou take it with you.\r\n[title=chest_open_end]\r\n\r\nNEOLITH ROOM PRE-SHARK\r\n\r\n[title=wark_0_begin]\r\nResearcher Wark: Awhile back HQ had us stationed out in some remote part of the sea, investigating the disappearance of another team.\r\nResearcher Wark: Never found 'em, unfortunately. Rumor has it they got swept up by a massive squid monster or something. Who knows.\r\nResearcher Wark: Guess there's always some downsides when it comes to doing a little <i>oceanwork</i>.\r\n[title=wark_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=briles_0_begin]\r\nResearcher Briles: Hey, you don't look like part of the backup team HQ sent down. Just some independently funded researcher passing through?\r\nResearcher Briles: Lot of the other rooms were sealed off somehow, we have yet to figure that out. You should go talk to Rolk if you need some direction.\r\n[title=briles_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=scotch_0_begin]\r\nResearcher Scotch: This massive neolith we've unearthed is incredible. Based on our calculations it could have been created during a period of <b>protohistory</b>.\r\nResearcher Scotch: Imagine... a civilization buried thousands of miles beneath an uncharted ocean, only to slowly rise over the course of a hundred centuries.\r\n[title=scotch_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=meg_0_begin]\r\nResearcher Meg: I've managed to deciper a few small segments of these runes, and they paint a pretty strange picture.\r\nResearcher Meg: The name "<b>Edax</b>" keeps showing up a number of times, shown in the context of something catastrophic happening.\r\nResearcher Meg: Absolutely fascinating.\r\n[title=meg_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=rolk_0_begin]\r\nCaptain Rolk: Hmm? You second string? No... but your gear tells me HQ musta sent you down here to help us somehow.\r\nCaptain Rolk: Here's the skinny, rookie- we recently unearthed this neolith, but can't quite make sense of it's purpose.\r\nCaptain Rolk: It's giving me some weird vibes... there's gotta be something going on. Unfortunately, we're a little short staffed.\r\nCaptain Rolk: If you're able, see if you can assist. A fresh pair of eyes is always good. I'll be sure to give a good word to HQ if you find anything.\r\n[title=rolk_0_end]\r\n\r\nAFTER ROLK (LEAVING ROOM TRIGGER?)\r\n\r\n[title=rolk_1_begin]\r\nCaptain Rolk: Hey, look out! The lattice is collapsing! Protect the scanning equipment!\r\n[title=rolk_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=rolk_2_begin]\r\nCaptain Rolk: Whew, that was a close one. The neolith was almost damaged! We can't risk this thing's pristine condition for a second.\r\nCaptain Rolk: Anyways, no harm seems to have been done. We haven't received any new information on the neolith, so keep searching.\r\n[title=rolk_2_end]\r\n\r\n[title=scotch_1_begin]\r\nResearcher Scotch: Can you believe that? Millions in funding this expedition for the preservation of ancient discoveries and they skimp on our support lattice.\r\n[title=scotch_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=briles_1_begin]\r\nResearcher Briles: Typical corporate budget cuts. Even our equipment isn't cutting edge enough to break these numbers down. What are we even doing here?\r\n[title=briles_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=meg_1_begin]\r\nResearcher Meg: Traced a bit more of these runes through my scanning equipment and I gotta say, it gets more foreboding.\r\nResearcher Meg: This "<b>Edax</b>" was some sort of deity, or demigod, or something... Can't tell if it was malevolent or what...\r\nResearcher Meg: I'm going to keep digging to see what more I can find.\r\n[title=meg_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=neolith_0_begin]\r\nAtop the neolith you discover a strange but familiar <color=#f5e042><b>yellow cube</b></color>. You take it with you.\r\n[title=neolith_0_end]\r\n\r\nAFTER NEOLITH\r\n\r\n[title=scotch_11_begin]\r\nResearcher Scotch: This damn pillar's givin' me a real uneasy feeling. The noise it makes is just... enough to send chills down my spine.\r\nResearcher Scotch: Don't you hear it? Sounds like a beacon trying to signal something waiting in the <i>deep ocean</i>...\r\n[title=scotch_11_end]\r\n\r\n[title=briles_11_begin]\r\nResearcher Briles: What's with us always ending up finding the creepiest artifacts down here? I tell you, this job has its downsides.\r\nResearcher Briles: Always giant monoliths and monsters. Just once I'd like to find a nice, friendly eel, or something. Anything!\r\n[title=briles_11_end]\r\n\r\n[title=meg_11_begin]\r\nResearcher Meg: Okay, I think I've cracked most of it... According to these runes, this "<b>Edax</b>" was an all-consuming abomination of the seas.\r\nResearcher Meg: It goes on to say that they were confined to a prison of ultimate solitude, to keep them from ever escaping back into the world.\r\nResearcher Meg: Thank goodness for that. Simply incredible.\r\n[title=meg_11_end]\r\n\r\n[title=rolk_3_begin]\r\nCaptain Rolk: Saw you hopping along the damaged support lattice. That's a big safety violation, rookie! I'll let it slip though since it got you atop the neolith.\r\nCaptain Rolk: [question=11]So, was there anything up there or do you think we're just wasting our time?\r\n[choice]Something.[newtalk start=rolk_yes_begin break=rolk_yes_end]\r\n[choice]Nothing.[newtalk start=rolk_no_begin break=rolk_no_end]\r\n[title=rolk_3_end]\r\n\r\n[title=rolk_no_begin]\r\nCaptain Rolk: Nothing? Damn! We've scoured every inch of this old rock for months and haven't come close to finding anything worthwhile.\r\nCaptain Rolk: Well, thanks anyways. If you plan on checking out any more of the megastructure, I'd be interested to know of anything you find.\r\n[title=rolk_no_end]\r\n\r\n[title=rolk_yes_begin]\r\nCaptain Rolk: You did?! Well, what was it?! Let's have a look then...\r\n(Rolk looks at the <color=#f5e042><b>artifact</b></color> you collected and examines it with his scanner.)\r\nCaptain Rolk: Hmm. No initial readings. Strange... Ok, I'll relay this info to the rest of the team. You hold onto that artifact for now.\r\nCaptain Rolk: From this point on, I want you to report directly back to me in the event you find any additional anomalies.\r\n[title=rolk_yes_end]\r\n\r\nOUTER SHARK STATUES COMPLETED\r\n\r\n[title=shark_statue_red11_begin]\r\nAnother strange statue stands ominously, holding out its empty hands.\r\n[question=33]Will you try placing the <color=#f54242><b>red cube</b></color> you collected?\r\n[choice]Yes.[newtalk start=cube_red_11_begin break=cube_red_11_end]\r\n[choice]No.[newtalk start=cube_no_1_begin break=cube_no_1_end]\r\n[title=shark_statue_red11_end]\r\n\r\n[title=shark_statue_yellow11_begin]\r\nAnother strange statue stands ominously, holding out its empty hands.\r\n[question=33]Will you try placing the <color=#f5e042><b>yellow cube</b></color> you collected?\r\n[choice]Yes.[newtalk start=cube_yellow_11_begin break=cube_yellow_11_end]\r\n[choice]No.[newtalk start=cube_no_1_begin break=cube_no_1_end]\r\n[title=shark_statue_yellow11_end]\r\n\r\n[title=cube_no_1_begin]\r\nYou back up from the statue.\r\n[title=cube_no_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=cube_red_11_begin]\r\nYou place the <color=#f54242><b>red cube</b></color> in the statue's hands.[event=10]\r\nIt's a perfect, seamless fit.

There's a small inscription below that reads -\r\n"We cannot hear her tongue for she speaks no words.
