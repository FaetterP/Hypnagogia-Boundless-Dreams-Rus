Very... convenient.[event=1]\r\n???: Welcome to the nexus for everything that exists as you currently know it. Which is to say isn't much right now, unfortunately.\r\n???: You may yet have a role to play as these events begin to unfold. Things are not as they normally are, you see.\r\nHypno: Forgive me, where are my manners? I am called <color=#b642f5><b>Hypno</b></color>... I am the <i>guardian</i> of this place.\r\nHypno: [question=0]I am sure you have many questions, or none at all perhaps.\r\n[choice]Where are we?[newtalk start=hypno_choice_1_begin break=hypno_choice_1_end]\r\n[choice]What's going on?[newtalk start=hypno_choice_2_begin break=hypno_choice_2_end]\r\n[choice]That's enough.[newtalk start=hypno_choice_3_begin break=hypno_choice_3_end]\r\n[title=hypno_0_intro_end]\r\n\r\nHYPNO CHOICE 1 WHERE\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_choice_1_begin]\r\nHypno: We are in the <color=#fffc36><b>Dream Nexus</b></color> of course. The origin of which is not important, but to you it acts as a means to an end.\r\nHypno: [question=1]It is a temporary space used for passing through from one world, to the next. A metaphorical series of interconnecting tubes and tunnels.\r\n[choice]What's going on?[newtalk start=hypno_choice_2_begin break=hypno_choice_2_end]\r\n[choice]That's enough.[newtalk start=hypno_choice_3_begin break=hypno_choice_3_end]\r\n[title=hypno_choice_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_choice_2_begin]\r\nHypno: [question=2]The precious <color=#42f5e6><b>Dream Crystal</b></color> has shattered... unexpectedly.

Think of it as the living, beating heart of everything you've ever imagined and have yet to imagine. It's also the thing floating above us.\r\nHypno: [question=3]As a whole entity, it keeps in check the flow of all conscious and subconsious information. Broken however, things are left to form how they please.\r\n[choice]Remnants?[newtalk start=hypno_choice_2_2_begin break=hypno_choice_2_2_end]\r\n[choice]Where are we?[newtalk start=hypno_choice_1_begin break=hypno_choice_1_end]\r\n[choice]That's enough.[newtalk start=hypno_choice_3_begin break=hypno_choice_3_end]\r\n[title=hypno_choice_2_1_end]\r\n\r\nHYPNO CHOICE 2-2 REMNANTS\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_choice_2_2_begin]\r\nHypno: Yes... With your help, we can return the pieces of the <color=#42f5e6><b>Dream Crystal</b></color> to the nexus and restore a much needed <i>balance</i> to this world.\r\nHypno: [question=4]Travel through the portals to each dream and find the shattered remains of the crystal. That is the part you play. This is your role.\r\n[choice]Tell me again.[newtalk start=hypno_choice_2_3_begin break=hypno_choice_2_3_end]\r\n[choice]Where are we?[newtalk start=hypno_choice_1_begin break=hypno_choice_1_end]\r\n[choice]I am ready now.[newtalk start=hypno_choice_33_begin break=hypno_choice_33_end]\r\n[title=hypno_choice_2_2_end]\r\n\r\nHYPNO CHOICE 2-3 REPEAT\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_choice_2_3_begin]\r\nHypno: Hmm? Were you not paying attention the first time? I will explain once more. But be wary, the dreamscape will only be here for so long. As I said before...\r\nHypno: [question=5]The precious <color=#42f5e6><b>Dream Crystal</b></color> has shattered... unexpectedly. Its fragments spread throughout consciousness.

One would not want to linger for too long. You have many places to go, many people to see, certain things to... retrieve.\r\nHypno: One last thing. Though you may only be required to enter specific dreams, there are some that are, let's say... <color=#fffc36><b>hidden</b></color> in the darker corners.\r\nHypno: In other words, try not to let your taste for exploration wane <i>too much</i>. Now go. We are all watching...[event=0]\r\n[title=hypno_choice_3_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_choice_33_begin]\r\nHypno: Wasting no more time, I see. Excellent. You've learned quickly. Now we will see if you maintain that level of spirit throughout the journey...[event=2]\r\nHypno: One last thing. Though you may only be required to enter specific dreams, there are some that are, let's say... <color=#fffc36><b>hidden</b></color> in the darker corners.\r\nHypno: In other words, try not to let your taste for exploration wane <i>too much</i>. Now go. We are all watching...[event=0]\r\n[title=hypno_choice_33_end]\r\n\r\nHYPNO CHOICE 3 PASS AGAIN\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_choice_3_1_begin]\r\nHypno: Very well. Hurry back with the fragments. This world's power grows more weakened by the minute.\r\n[title=hypno_choice_3_1_end]\r\n\r\nHYPNO TALK AGAIN\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_0_repeat_begin]\r\nHypno: [question=6]Mm... still have questions, it seems? I wait eagerly for you to begin the journey.\r\n[choice]Where are we?[newtalk start=hypno_choice_1_begin break=hypno_choice_1_end]\r\n[choice]What's going on?[newtalk start=hypno_choice_2_begin break=hypno_choice_2_end]\r\n[choice]Nevermind.[newtalk start=hypno_choice_3_1_begin break=hypno_choice_3_1_end]\r\n[title=hypno_0_repeat_end]\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_choice_no_begin]\r\nHypno: Hmph. Forgive me, in my old age I've almost forgotten how limited your time is with us. Tread carefully...\r\n[title=hypno_choice_no_end]\r\n\r\nMAIN HUB 02\r\n[title=hypno_mist_begin]\r\nHypno: I see you've collected the first shard of many. Good... very good. You seem to have some familiarity in what you're doing.\r\nHypno: Although it's apparent to me you've not yet given much thought to your surroundings. Just existing in them like many others.\r\nHypno: [question=7]Tell me, while the subject is at the forefront - what do you think of other people?\r\n[choice]They're kind.[newtalk start=hypno_mist_choice0_begin break=hypno_mist_choice0_end]\r\n[choice]They're repulsive.[newtalk start=hypno_mist_choice1_begin break=hypno_mist_choice1_end]\r\n[choice]They're overbearing.[newtalk start=hypno_mist_choice2_begin break=hypno_mist_choice2_end]\r\n[choice]Gotta go.[newtalk start=hypno_choice_no_begin break=hypno_choice_no_end]\r\n[title=hypno_mist_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_mist_choice0_begin]\r\nHypno: Hmph. <b>Kind</b> is it? Such a simple word to describe such a simple species, whether it's true or not.\r\nHypno: Some would say it's naive to feel such a way. Those creatures tend to display their animosity more than their kindness.\r\nHypno: In your case, you are indeed proving the latter by helping reclaim these shards. Too soon to judge, perhaps...?\r\nHypno: Enough talk. Keep your wits about you. I will be watching.\r\n[title=hypno_mist_choice0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_mist_choice1_begin]\r\nHypno: <b>Repulsive?</b> Haha. You jest, however there must be an aspect of truth to a species so inattentive and disrepectful to the world around it.\r\nHypno: Forgive me - there's no need to lecture you on a topic so broad and sensitive. I'm sure you have your own opinions.\r\nHypno: It may be fruitless to dwell on it for too long, but... it's only what I've heard anyways.\r\nHypno: Enough talk. Keep your wits about you. I will be watching.\r\n[title=hypno_mist_choice1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_mist_choice2_begin]\r\nHypno: <b>Overbearing</b>, you say? An interesting thought. There are many I feel would prefer to live free from the annoyance of others.\r\nHypno: Ironic it is that they themselves unwittingly give overbearance to others. A strange, ignorant little cycle I must say.\r\nHypno: You'd be wise not to let something as insignificant as secondhand oppression dictate your decisions. That's just what I've heard anyways.\r\nHypno: Enough talk. Keep your wits about you. I will be watching.\r\n[title=hypno_mist_choice2_end]\r\n\r\nMAIN HUB 03\r\n[title=hypno_bamboo_begin]\r\nHypno: Already gathered the second shard, have you? Your speed is rivaled only by your patience to continue on through this laborous ordeal.\r\nHypno: If only I wasn't tied to this so-called "dream nexus", I would assist. An accursed shell of its former self. Weakened, vulnerable...\r\nHypno: Its strength and mine continues to wane. Soon there will be nothing left but a black void and empty dreams. You must hurry.\r\nHypno: Enough talk. Keep your wits about you. I will be watching.\r\n[title=hypno_bamboo_end]\r\n\r\nMAIN HUB 05\r\n[title=hypno_space_begin]\r\nHypno: Such expedience... I've been keeping a close watch from here. Looks like you've hit the half-way mark already. Excellent.\r\nHypno: Dreams are transient things. Although you pass from one to the next, a piece of you will always remain. But beware...\r\nHypno: [question=8]There are many creatures who aren't who they claim to be. Trust is a valuable commodity no matter the setting. Who do you trust?\r\n[choice]You.[newtalk start=hypno_space_choice0_begin break=hypno_space_choice0_end]\r\n[choice]Gogi.[newtalk start=hypno_space_choice1_begin break=hypno_space_choice1_end]\r\n[choice]Myself.[newtalk start=hypno_space_choice2_begin break=hypno_space_choice2_end]\r\n[choice]No one.[newtalk start=hypno_space_choice3_begin break=hypno_space_choice3_end]\r\n[title=hypno_space_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_space_choice0_begin]\r\nHypno: <b>Me?</b> However much that sentiment is appreciated, it would be quite a heedless act to give trust to someone you were so recently acquainted with.\r\nHypno: Nevertheless, I'm acutely aware I have that affect on most creatures. Some say it's good to befriend those who give the most intimidating impressions.\r\nHypno: That's enough talk for now. Keep your wits about you. I will be watching.\r\n[title=hypno_space_choice0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_space_choice1_begin]\r\nHypno: <b>Gogi?</b> Do you truly believe that someone as negligent as the dream protector can be trusted? He abandoned his duties as soon as he was needed most.\r\nHypno: It would be unwise of you to believe anything from such a careless and irresponsible character. But... I won't tell you what to do.\r\nHypno: That's enough talk for now. Keep your wits about you. I will be watching.\r\n[title=hypno_space_choice1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_space_choice2_begin]\r\nHypno: A double-edged sword. Full trust in only <b>yourself</b> can lead down multiple roads... some of which you may regret going down.\r\nHypno: Words of caution... in the end you will have been the cause of both your problems and the solutions that need them. You will be the only one to blame.\r\nHypno: That's enough talk for now. Keep your wits about you. I will be watching.\r\n[title=hypno_space_choice2_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_space_choice3_begin]\r\nHypno: Quite perceptive, but perhaps ill-advised. Give trust to <b>no one</b> and you will never be disappointed, keep it too sheltered however...\r\nHypno: ...and you will inevitably encounter a problem you'll find impossible to solve alone. For this your trust must be spent wisely.\r\nHypno: That's enough talk for now. Keep your wits about you. I will be watching.\r\n[title=hypno_space_choice3_end]\r\n\r\nMAIN HUB 06\r\n[title=hypno_mansion_begin]\r\nHypno: This surge of power... this swell of intense energy... I can feel the <color=#42f5e6><b>shards</b></color> slowly returning their strength to the gem.\r\nHypno: [question=9]The longer they go disconnected and incomplete... the more unstable things become. The more nightmarish things become.\r\n[choice]I'm afraid.[newtalk start=hypno_mansion_afraid_begin break=hypno_mansion_afraid_end]\r\n[choice]I can do this.[newtalk start=hypno_mansion0_begin break=hypno_mansion0_end]\r\n[choice]Lovely hat.[newtalk start=hypno_mansion_hat_begin break=hypno_mansion_hat_end]\r\n[title=hypno_mansion_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_mansion_afraid_begin]\r\nHypno: Fear is a natural feeling. Fall further into the dream world and the fear deepens with it. Overcoming that is paramount to your success...[newtalk start=hypno_mansion0_begin break=hypno_mansion0_end]\r\n[title=hypno_mansion_afraid_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_mansion_hat_begin]\r\nHypno: However flattering they may be, now is not the time for such lighthearted and childish remarks. An important reminder not to get distracted...[newtalk start=hypno_mansion0_begin break=hypno_mansion0_end]\r\n[title=hypno_mansion_hat_end]\r\n\r\n[title=hypno_mansion0_begin]\r\nHypno: The paths ahead are not for the faint of heart. Your endurance... perserverance... fortitude... will all be tested.\r\nHypno: Although there may yet still remain controlled pockets of the dreamscape <color=#fffc36><b>hidden</b></color> in certain places.\r\nHypno: Good luck... \r\n[title=hypno_mansion0_end]\r\n\r\nMAIN HUB 08\r\n[title=hypno_tower_begin]\r\nHypno: It's almost time. The <color=#42f5e6><b>gem</b></color> is nearly completed, the hypnagogic dreamscape draws to a finality, and power will be restored, all thanks to you.\r\nHypno: Your persistent strength thus far has gone beyond impressive, and for that I commend you. Although the journey is not yet over, remember...\r\nHypno: You will be told lies and untruths from lesser beings who only wish to take control of the dreamscape themselves. To listen would be foolish.\r\nHypno: Face your true self in these final moments. Overcome weakness. Face absolution. Face the end.\r\n[title=hypno_tower_end]\r\n\r\n\r\n[title=guide_0_begin]\r\n???: Wow, so you beat the <b>whole game</b>, huh? Or at least, the main levels. Either way, welcome to the <i>Dream Select Hub!</i>\r\n???: From here not only can you can revisit any main world as many times as you want, you can also get some behind-the-scenes info on each one!\r\n???: So, if you happened to previously miss a <color=#fffc36><b>secret level</b></color> or anything interesting, here's your second opportunity. Pretty cool, right?\r\n???: Oh- I almost forgot! The big guy let me in on some cool insider news. Apparently there's a really well-hidden <b>secret</b> here too...\r\n???: <i>(You didn't hear that from me, though.)</i> \\n\\nHave a good time!\r\n[title=guide_0_end]"
