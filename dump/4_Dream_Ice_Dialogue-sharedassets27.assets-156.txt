Is someone trying to talk to me? No time to talk.\r\nWanderer Reece: Walking keeps my mind busy. Gotta just focus on walking. Good exercise.\r\nWanderer Reece: Sorry... I gotta go... *Cough cough* \r\n[title=walking_0_end]\r\n\r\nDOG TOY\r\n[title=toy_0_begin]\r\nThere's some kind of squeaky <color=#fc0328><b>red ball</b></color> half-buried in the snow. A kid's toy maybe?\r\nYou have no reason to mess with it, so you leave it alone.\r\n[title=toy_0_end]\r\n\r\nGUY START\r\n[title=guy_start_0_begin]\r\nHomeless Phil: One day, long ago, it started snowing. The bright and wonderful flakes astounded all of us. We were truly breathless.\r\nHomeless Phil: This was once a hot and humid place to live, so despite our shock, we welcomed the change. Boy did we need it...\r\nHomeless Phil: But then... it snowed more, and even more, and kept snowing. It continued for many years, and is still going.\r\nHomeless Phil: We're now forced to live with our situation. We never knew how good we had it until it was taken away from us.\r\n[title=guy_start_0_end]\r\n\r\nGUY 0\r\n[title=guy_0_0_begin]\r\nHomeless Frankie: I remember riding to work everyday like it was normal, like what everyone else did. Just doing what we always do.\r\nHomeless Frankie: But now, the one and only thing keeping me going is hoping we'll see the sun again one day.\r\nHomeless Frankie: I've got plenty of warm fire to hold me over until then, I just don't know if it will be enough.\r\nHomeless Frankie: I know how much others may be in need, so feel free to keep yourself warm here anytime.\r\n[title=guy_0_0_end]\r\n\r\nGUY FISHING\r\n[title=guy_fish_0_begin]\r\nFisherman Joe: Hey there, wanderer. Don't pay me no nevermind. Just doing a little fishing.\r\nFisherman Joe: [question=0]You're dressed pretty light given the weather.

Now I know what you're thinking. "Surely the fish under here would've all turned into ice cubes by now."\r\nFisherman Joe: Well, there's no way to know really. This pond froze over years ago. It's probably a mile of ice beneath us.\r\nFisherman Joe: Far as I'm concerned there ARE fish down there. All I needs is patience. Lots of patience. I won't let the cold put me down.[newtalk start=guy_fish_0_repeat_begin break=guy_fish_0_repeat_end]\r\n[title=answer_fish_0_end]\r\n\r\nGUY FISHING CHOICE 2\r\n[title=answer_fish_1_begin]\r\nFisherman Joe: Ah, you'll get used to it. We're a species with surprising resilience, so I'm sure you are too. Just don't think about it too much.\r\nFisherman Joe: Between you and me, I don't mind it. Even maybe like it a little. I mean, if I get too cold, I just bundle up more. Too hot and I lighten up.\r\nFisherman Joe: Can't really do that when the weather is scorching from the start, y'know? Silver-linings and all that.[newtalk start=guy_fish_0_repeat_begin break=guy_fish_0_repeat_end]\r\n[title=answer_fish_1_end]\r\n\r\nGUY FISHING CHOICE 3\r\n[title=answer_fish_2_begin]\r\nFisherman Joe: Alrighty then.

See ya 'round.\r\n[title=guy_fence_bye_end]\r\n\r\n[title=guy_fence_01_begin]\r\nLittle Ollie: This billboard fell a long time ago... the way's been junked up with all this warped rusty metal.\r\nLittle Ollie: My parents told me to stay away, but you know that just means there's gotta be something interesting over there.\r\nLittle Ollie: I'll find a way through if it's the last thing I do![event=8]\r\n[title=guy_fence_01_end]\r\n\r\nGUY 2\r\n[title=guy_2_0_begin]\r\nHomeless Moe: Hey, what's happenin'? This spot's gotten a bit warmer since I nestled into it.\r\nHomeless Moe: That guy over there's been around here longer than me, and he's still not used to the cold!\r\nHomeless Moe: Crazy. I guess some people just never get used to it.\r\n[title=guy_2_0_end]\r\n\r\nGUY 3\r\n[title=guy_3_0_begin]\r\nHomeless Bailey: Hey, this is new. Someone came to visit me! That's unusual. Most people always avoid this part of town.\r\nHomeless Bailey: It was just me for months! Some other guy moved in upstairs recently, but before then... this building was completely abandoned.\r\nHomeless Bailey: I think there was another person that used to live here waaay back, but I don't know what happened to them.\r\nHomeless Bailey: Anyways, you can stay for as long as you want. The company makes things a little warmer.\r\n[title=guy_3_0_end]\r\n\r\nGUY GHOST\r\n[title=guy_ghost_0_begin]\r\n???: Excuse me... sorry to trouble you, but have you seen my <color=#fcbe2b><b>dog</b></color>? She left me so long ago, I don't even remember what she looks like.\r\n???: I haven't gotten any sleep in who knows how long. She's probably so cold. I would do anything to have her back.\r\n???: If I could go look for her I would, but something's... keeping me here. If you see her, would you find a way to send her here?\r\n???: Although, she might not listen to you unless you have her favorite shiny <color=#fc0328><b>red ball</b></color>.

I'll be here if you find anything out.[event=5]\r\n[title=answer_ghost_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_ghost_1_begin]\r\n???: I'll keep on waiting then, for someone who can help me. I hope you reconsider.\r\n[title=answer_ghost_1_end]\r\n\r\nROUND 2\r\n\r\nGUY GHOST\r\n[title=guy_ghost_1_begin]\r\n???: Have you had any luck? Make sure you find her favorite <color=#fc0328><b>red ball</b></color>, or else she might not listen to you.\r\n???: I hope you manage to find her. She always had such a habit of climbing up places she couldn't get down from.\r\n[title=guy_ghost_1_end]\r\n\r\nGUY 3\r\n[title=guy_3_1_begin]\r\nHomeless Bailey: Hope I'm not making you uncomfortable or anything. I've just never had any friends.\r\nHomeless Bailey: You can leave anytime you like, I won't be upset... (well maybe a little.)\r\n[title=guy_3_1_end]\r\n\r\nGUY 2\r\n[title=guy_2_1_begin]\r\nHomeless Moe: Hey, hey, be careful! Whew, it's getting a little stuffed in here. Three's a crowd, y'know?\r\nHomeless Moe: Maybe take some refuge in that building down the street instead? Should have more room than in here.\r\n[title=guy_2_1_end]\r\n\r\nLAKE KID 1\r\n[title=guy_fence_11_begin]\r\nLittle Ollie: I'm trying to pry these plates off. They're pretty rusted so it shouldn't take too much longer.\r\nLittle Ollie: Check back in a little bit and I might have gotten them down by then.\r\n[title=guy_fence_11_end]\r\n\r\nLAKE KID 2\r\n[title=guy_fence_1_begin]\r\nLittle Ollie: I managed to tear a piece of that fence down from under the billboard earlier.\r\nLittle Ollie: We used to hear when we were younger this was where some kind of expedition came through.\r\nLittle Ollie: It happened a long time ago though, before I was born. I don't think they ever found the missing guy.\r\nLittle Ollie: Anyways, be careful. Who knows how little support is under all that untouched snow.\r\n[title=guy_fence_1_end]\r\n\r\nLAKE KID 3\r\n[title=guy_fence_12_begin]\r\nLittle Ollie: Holy moly. I knew that thing was destined to collapse someday. Be glad you weren't swallowed up there...\r\nLittle Ollie: Had no idea the old pipework was still pumping water underneath all this ice. What the...\r\nLittle Ollie: Welp, nevermind then. Good luck getting all the way up the chasm. I'll just uh, be back here.\r\n[title=guy_fence_12_end]\r\n\r\nGUY FISHING\r\n[title=guy_fish_1_begin]\r\nFisherman Joe: Hey again.

Beats doing absolutely nothing. They'll be biting soon though, you have my word.\r\nFisherman Joe: [question=2_2]Afterall, why not? Not much better ways to spend my time nowadays anyhow.\r\n[choice]Seen a dog?[newtalk start=answer_fish_4_begin break=answer_fish_4_end]\r\n[choice]Later then.[newtalk start=answer_fish_2_0_begin break=answer_fish_2_0_end]\r\n[title=answer_fish_3_end]\r\n\r\nGUY FISHING CHOICE 2\r\n[title=answer_fish_4_begin]\r\nFisherman Joe: A <color=#fcbe2b><b>dog</b></color>? Ain't seen a dog for, oh, how long's it been...? Years now. They might've been around when this place was hotter... but not anymore.\r\nFisherman Joe: Heh, maybe they've all gone an' migrated south for the winter! Eh, sorry. No clue, friend.\r\nFisherman Joe: [question=3]What reason you looking for a dog anyhow? Seems like a wild goose chase to me.\r\n[choice]Helping someone.[newtalk start=answer_fish_5_begin break=answer_fish_5_end]\r\n[choice]No reason.[newtalk start=answer_fish_2_0_begin break=answer_fish_2_0_end]\r\n[title=answer_fish_4_end]\r\n\r\nGUY FISHING CHOICE 3\r\n[title=answer_fish_2_0_begin]\r\nFisherman Joe: Alrighty then.

I'll be hanging around if you want to talk.\r\n[title=answer_fish_2_0_end]\r\n\r\nGUY FISHING CHOICE 1\r\n[title=answer_fish_5_begin]\r\nFisherman Joe: Not sure who that could be. No one in this frozen little village owns a dog. No one I know of at least.\r\nFisherman Joe: If you're keen on finding something lost though, maybe check around the old pond up north.\r\nFisherman Joe: Best be careful though, that trail's been long neglected. Could be pretty unstable going up there. Good luck.\r\n[title=answer_fish_5_end]\r\n\r\nGUY 0\r\n[title=guy_0_1_begin]\r\nHomeless Frankie: So hungry... I should go ask the fisherman when he thinks he'll finally catch a fish.\r\n[title=guy_0_1_end]\r\n\r\nSLEEPING GUY\r\n[title=guy_sleeping_1_begin]\r\nThere's just a bunch of snow here.\r\n[title=guy_sleeping_1_end]\r\n\r\nDOG TOY\r\n[title=toy_1_begin]\r\nThere's a squeaky <color=#fc0328><b>red ball</b></color> half-buried in the snow.\r\nThis looks like something a dog might enjoy. You brush the snow off and take it with you.\r\n[title=toy_1_end]\r\n\r\nGUY START\r\n[title=guy_start_1_begin]\r\nHomeless Phil: Hmm? Crazy to see you're still trudging through this cold hell. You've got some energy, y'know.\r\nHomeless Phil: Everybody gets tired at some point or another though. It's normal. No feeling bad about that.\r\nHomeless Phil: Feel free to hang out here if you're looking to get out of the unforgiving weather.\r\n[title=guy_start_1_end]\r\n\r\nROUND 3\r\n\r\nSTRAY DOG\r\n[title=dog_0_begin]\r\nDog: Woof! Woof!\r\nThere's a stray dog. It looks like it's somehow gotten all the way up here and can't get back down.\r\nIt appears rather timid, but you can tell it's just as surprised as you are at this encounter.\r\n[question=4]What should you do?\r\n[choice]Pet the dog.[newtalk start=answer_dog_0_begin break=answer_dog_0_end]\r\n[choice]Leave it alone.[newtalk start=answer_dog_1_begin break=answer_dog_1_end]\r\n[choice]Look for a tag.[newtalk start=answer_dog_2_begin break=answer_dog_2_end]\r\n[title=dog_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=dog_0_repeat_begin]\r\n[question=4]The dog sits patiently.

Hey, no fair Lucas!\r\n[title=guy0_snowball0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=guy0_snowball1_begin]\r\nLittle Tilly: I wonder if Ollie ever got to tearing that fence down over by the old billboard.\r\nLittle Tilly: He's missing out on all this intense snow action. Oh well.\r\n[title=guy0_snowball1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=guy0_snowball2_begin]\r\nLittle Tilly: Damn, I thought we'd get to actually travel up that trail Ollie found and finally see what's up there.\r\nLittle Tilly: Wait, what?
