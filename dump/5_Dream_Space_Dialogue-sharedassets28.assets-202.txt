Very shiny. You like shiny things.\r\nWith it equipped you should be able to float around the environment with ease.\r\n[question=0]Will you take the pack?\r\n[choice]What? Yes![newtalk start=jetpack_yes_begin break=jetpack_yes_end]\r\n[choice]No chance.[newtalk start=jetpack_no_begin break=jetpack_no_end]\r\n[title=jetpack_0_end]\r\n\r\nJETPACK CHOICE YES\r\n[title=jetpack_yes_begin]\r\nYou take and equip the rocket pack. You can boost by tapping and holding the <b><color=#eded24>jump button</color></b>! [event=0]\r\n[title=jetpack_yes_end]\r\n\r\nJETPACK CHOICE NO\r\n[title=jetpack_no_begin]\r\nYou leave the rocket pack alone for some reason. It looks so awesome though.\r\n[title=jetpack_no_end]\r\n\r\nLOCKED SPACE DOOR\r\n[title=lockeddoor_0_begin]\r\nThere's a bulky iris door here, but it won't open. Something is keeping it shut.\r\n[title=lockeddoor_0_end]\r\n\r\nCODEX KEY\r\n[title=codex_0_begin]\r\nA codex of cosmic information. It's transcribed in an ancient language you will never understand.\r\nDespite your apprehension, you touch it and become imprinted with the ability to continue onward.\r\n[title=codex_0_end]\r\n\r\nSHAPEZOID 0\r\n[title=shape_0_begin]\r\nShapezoid: Hmm. <i>Weird</i>. How <i>interdasting</i>. Many of the doors have locked themselves somehow. Never has this happened before.\r\nShapezoid: All of us can just teleport around freely though, so it doesn't bother me really. You on the other hand...\r\nShapezoid: You might have some trouble materializing through solid walls. So... yeah. Good luck figuring that one out.\r\nShapezoid: <color=#ae52b3><b>The Eye</b></color> has requested our presence, so I've gotta bounce. Stay fresh, meat bag.\r\n[title=shape_0_end]\r\n\r\nSHAPEZOID 00\r\n[title=shape_00_begin]\r\nShapezoid: To simply observe a place so sterile, so full of one-dimensional concepts, it is monotony. My only eye begs to be mercifully gouged. \r\nShapezoid: Knowing exactly how everything works and what precisely the future holds, but not being able to express any of it into words, that is my curse.\r\nShapezoid: Wipe that dumb look off your face. It's just a joke. I actually don't know anything, but it's okay because neither do you.\r\nShapezoid: I can only guess what you're thinking right now, but <color=#ae52b3><b>The Eye</b></color> doesn't need to guess. It tells all of us exactly what we need to know.\r\n[title=shape_00_end]\r\n\r\nSHAPEZOID 1\r\n[title=shape_1_begin]\r\nShapezoid: <i>Uaugh. Auaahhghhh... Mghhm</i>. Huh? What? Oh. I'm not feeling great today. I think maybe it's just my lack of sleep lately.\r\nShapezoid: I keep seeing these intense, repeating patterns all over the place. It's been driving me mad and keeping me up. Can't you see them?\r\nShapezoid: Not only that, but I can't find a way to stop them or even slow them down. Keeping a grip on this kind of stuff is... hard.\r\nShapezoid: Just... just talk to someone else. <color=#ae52b3><b>The Eye</b></color> is watching us. I gotta go before it gets angry.\r\n[title=shape_1_end]\r\n\r\nSHAPEZOID 1.1\r\n[title=shape_11_begin]\r\nShapezoid: I find it alarming how many people display such a callous penchant for loud and abrasive destruction.\r\nShapezoid: I'd be lying if I said I didn't have similar feelings every so often myself... it does tend to excite the mind.\r\nShapezoid: Too much of it though, and you realize how dull it all eventually becomes. Then nothing means anything anymore.\r\nShapezoid: This conversation has you looking a little flushed. Come back in a few minutes and I'll have <color=#fcbe2b><b>something special</b></color> for you.\r\n[title=shape_11_end]\r\n\r\n[title=shape_12_begin]\r\nShapezoid: Your special prize isn't ready yet, but I've taken the liberty of recording, cataloging, and archiving your impatience.\r\nShapezoid: The ringular tubules and turbines of our engine room are calling out to you. Pay it a visit and then return.\r\n[title=shape_12_end]\r\n\r\nSHAPEZOID 2\r\n[title=shape_2_begin]\r\nShapezoid: There's a threshold to anything and everything. Every good beginning connects with an ending at some point, as they say.\r\nShapezoid: I think what's most important isn't either of those, but what happens during the in-between. Every step, every move counts.\r\nShapezoid: For better or for worse, you're in the middle of that in-between. Right now. At this moment.\r\nShapezoid: As quickly as we float through this strange ether, we'll just as quickly leave it. Here, I'll demonstrate.\r\n[title=shape_2_end]\r\n\r\nSHAPEZOID 2.1\r\n[title=shape_21_begin]\r\nShapezoid: Feeling like this place is already getting a bit tedious? That's too bad. Lots of things are tedious. <b>LIFE</b> is tedious.\r\nShapezoid: You'll whine and complain until time comes to an end, and even still you'll keep going. Yell into the void, it will pretend to listen.\r\nShapezoid: I'll give you something for all your "trouble". It's the least I can do for someone so... impatient.\r\nShapezoid: Turn around. Press the button. <color=#ae52b3><b>The Eye</b></color> is calling, sad to say I won't be around for what happens next.\r\n[title=shape_21_end]\r\n\r\n[title=button_begin]\r\nThere's a big, red, shiny button here you don't remember seeing before. What could it activate you wonder?\r\n[question=06]It looks important, and you have the strongest urge to press it. But then again, maybe you shouldn't?\r\n[choice]Press.[newtalk start=button_yes_begin break=button_yes_end]\r\n[choice]Ignore.[newtalk start=button_no_begin break=button_no_end]\r\n[title=button_end]\r\n\r\n[title=button_yes_begin]\r\nYou press the button...[event=1]\r\n[title=button_yes_end]\r\n\r\n[title=button_no_begin]\r\nYou decide not to indulge in such an act of frivolous button-pressing.\r\n[title=button_no_end]\r\n\r\nSHAPEZOID 3\r\n[title=shape_3_begin]\r\nShapezoid: <i>Heeeeeeeyy</i>... yup. Just floating here. Y'know, as ya do sometimes. You seem to have been getting your way around here fairly well.\r\nShapezoid: Can I ask you a favor? If things were to all of a sudden stop right now, and I had to fall, would you catch me?\r\nShapezoid: I'm deathly afraid of heights. I mean, I'm afraid of a lot of things. But anything high up leaves me frozen in fear.\r\nShapezoid: <color=#ae52b3><b>The Eye</b></color> knows what we're all afraid of. It's calling to you and me. We can't keep it waiting.\r\n[title=shape_3_end]\r\n\r\nSHAPEZOID 4\r\n[title=shape_4_begin]\r\nShapezoid: Hey, this is <i>MY</i> room. You can't just fly down in here and start touching things without my permission. Are you crazy?\r\nShapezoid: Ugh, whatever. I guess I have worse things to worry about. Way worse things. Things you wouldn't imagine.\r\nShapezoid: A lot of those things change constantly, but some of them have stayed the same. I just can't shake 'em.\r\nShapezoid: <color=#4d30db><b>The Eye</b></color>... It lives just out of my peripherals, watching everything we do. Don't believe it.\r\n[title=shape_4_end]\r\n\r\nBIG EVIL EYE MONSTER\r\n[title=eye_00_begin]\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: The outsider, the strange one, the <i>redeemer</i>. It at last approaches us. Willfull ignorance, or foolish haste? You are here now, as expected.\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: We have existed longer than time itself. Unchanging symbols to embody matter in all forms. Physical, metaphysical. You are different...\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: You are on a quest which has no end. Each step you take is paved with the forgotten dreams of a thousand dreamers.

The heart of the hypnagogic dreamscape. Indescribably minute in the grand scheme of all things.\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: We have floated through the endlessly expanding ether, reclaiming objects of importance to others. Keeping them within a vault from which nothing can escape.\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: This shard is one such object. Lost eons ago, it too was left there in the void. To take it back you must enter a realm of incomprehensible darkness.\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: [question=02]Enter the abyss below if your desire outweighs your fear. Stare deeply into it. It will stare back.

Mass consumerism. Digital propagation. War. These are all the building blocks which make up the world outside the dreamscape.\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: The chaos exists in many different sizes, doses, pockets, all around us.

Overbearing flames. Lurking demons. The augmentation of millions of realities meld into mere shadows of their former selves.\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: What your nightmares are made of... what they mean... only you will ever truly know.

They live life in purity. But what do they dream of? What are their nightmares?\r\nA̴i̸u̶k̵h̸i̶o̷p̸'̴r̸i̷h̷: Without them the void may only be that much deeper.
