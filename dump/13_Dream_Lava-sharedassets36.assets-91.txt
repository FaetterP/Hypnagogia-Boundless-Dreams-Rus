I haven't gotten the greenlight from our <color=#f74940><b>CEO</b></color> to start your interview yet. \r\nStakeholder Chet: Go over and get <color=#fcbe2b><b>Heckler</b></color> to grant you clearance.

The <color=#f74940><b>big man</b></color> upstairs sees everything we do, newbie.\r\nDrizzle: I'm a hard worker and do what I'm told though, so whatever you get up to doesn't bother me. You won't last long around here, heh.\r\nDrizzle: Hmm, let's make a deal. I know you're keen on trekking your way up there, so I'll help you out. The path ahead is pretty long-winded.\r\nDrizzle: If you want, I can have you all the way up the mountain in a flash, no strings attached.

Everything you see is mine, even those sniveling hopefuls down there. I inherited it all... ahem, well, EARNED it all.\r\nStan the CEO: So, I've been hearing from my underlings we're looking for a new Telestar intern. You think you're up to snuff? I've got a lot riding on this.\r\nStan the CEO: I'm going to see if you're worth the investment, so here's a little job for you. You see, my current employees have been a little... slack lately.\r\nStan the CEO: <color=#fcbe2b><b>Stakholder Chet</b></color> seems to think he's in charge of a lot more than he is. He's been really pushing my buttons lately, and that's no good.\r\nStan the CEO: My security chief <color=#fcbe2b><b>Heckler</b></color> is constantly sleeping on the job, every chance he can get. He's a sloppy waste of resources.\r\nStan the CEO: I need them both gone. Kaput. Flushed. <color=#f52a2a>FIRED</color>. I'm giving you temporary power of termination. Go down there and BURY those cretins.\r\nStan the CEO: Come back when the task is done.

And not in the good way.\r\nStan the CEO: It looks like my worthless employees are still up and walking around, taking up precious space in my dope underworld.\r\nStan the CEO: If you can't deal with them, I'll find someone who can.

Stocks have dropped .001% since we last spoke. Anyway, I've received word from the CEO that we're good to proceed to the next step.\r\nStakeholder Chet: Although... he was acting strange earlier. Told me "hope you know how to swim", whatever that means. Imbecile.\r\nStakeholder Chet: [question=4]Bah.
