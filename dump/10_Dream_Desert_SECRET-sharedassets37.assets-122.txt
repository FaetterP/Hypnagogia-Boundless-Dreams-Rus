New stranger just rolling up into town out of nowhere.\r\nWanderer Renzo: At least, I assume you did. New face to me. Anyways, welcome to this little dustbowl paradise.\r\nWanderer Renzo: Keep strolling ahead down the passage and you'll run into a <color=#fcbe2b><b>big camp</b></color>. Those folks'll probably wanna talk.\r\nWanderer Renzo: Remember - don't stray off the path and keep the sand out of your eyes, mate.\r\n[title=rabbit_0_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 1 lying on sofa solo\r\n[title=rabbit_1_begin]\r\nWanderer Fruz: This heat's unbearable during peak daytime hours. Luckily I manage to stay a little comfortable in the shade.\r\nWanderer Fruz: Stay out too long and you'll either burn to a crisp or get a nice blast of that razor sharp sand.\r\n[title=rabbit_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 2 Building campfire\r\n[title=rabbit_2_begin]\r\nWanderer Jess: Just because it's hot doesn't mean I can't enjoy the calming allure of a nice fire.\r\nWanderer Jess: Ever since the <i>great collapse</i> ages ago, listening to the crackling is one of the few pleasures I have left.\r\n[title=rabbit_2_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 3 Plateau Skuzzy\r\n[title=rabbit_3_begin]\r\nSkuzzy: The sands are shifting everyday, and more new secrets are constantly revealed.\r\nSkuzzy: A few of us have gone on an expedition recently to uncover more of this giant sandbox.\r\nSkuzzy: I think I may have found something up there but I can't reach it. If only I had my <color=yellow>strider</color>!\r\n[title=rabbit_3_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 4 Rider\r\n[title=rabbit_4_begin]\r\nJockey: Hey, whoa! Watch it! I nearly trampled over you! You crazy?\r\nJockey: I can't talk right now, I'm scanning the dunes for a way to deactivate those weird forcefields!\r\nJockey: If you wanna help, go talk to <color=#fcbe2b><b>Dusty</b></color> down at the center of town. Gotta go!\r\n[title=rabbit_4_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 5 Swimmer\r\n[title=rabbit_5_begin]\r\nSwimmer Garf: *gluhgh gluggh* We were busy checking out that forcefield over there but got bored!\r\nSwimmer Garf: The water is like, unimaginably cool being under all this shade... I couldn't resist. *gluhgh gluggh*\r\n[title=rabbit_5_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 6 waterside\r\n[title=rabbit_6_begin]\r\nWanderer Truffle: Hey, how's it goin'? That heat's really beating down on us today, huh. Don't let it get to you.\r\nWanderer Truffle: This part of the water is like a sauna. I can't get too comfortable though, we're on an expedition!\r\n[title=rabbit_6_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 7 sofa sitting\r\n[title=rabbit_7_begin]\r\nWanderer Haden: [question=0]Have you ever seen something out in the distance you could barely make out, but just knew it was there?\r\n[choice]Never.[newtalk start=rabbit_7_choice1_begin break=rabbit_7_choice1_end]\r\n[choice]Once.[newtalk start=rabbit_7_choice2_begin break=rabbit_7_choice2_end]\r\n[choice]All the time.[newtalk start=rabbit_7_choice3_begin break=rabbit_7_choice3_end]\r\n[title=rabbit_7_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 7 choice 1\r\n[title=rabbit_7_choice1_begin]\r\nWanderer Haden: Huh. I somehow doubt that. We all see things we recognize from a distance at some point or another.\r\nWanderer Haden: It's just a matter of believing it's real or not.\r\n[title=rabbit_7_choice1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 7 choice 2\r\n[title=rabbit_7_choice2_begin]\r\nWanderer Haden: I was walking along the dunes one day and swore I saw a ways away a massive cave made of <b>ice</b>.\r\nWanderer Haden: It glowed white with specks of crystalline blue and green, I remember even feeling a slight chill.\r\nWanderer Haden: But as I got closer, the mouth of the cave grew smaller and smaller, until it metered out into the horizon.\r\nWanderer Haden: The sun does things to you sometimes.\r\n[title=rabbit_7_choice2_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 7 choice 3\r\n[title=rabbit_7_choice3_begin]\r\nWanderer Haden: I think you may be on the verge of heat exhaustion. Why don't you take a seat and rest in the shade with us?\r\n[title=rabbit_7_choice3_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 8 standing corner\r\n[title=rabbit_8_begin]\r\nWanderer Wryn: These buildings stood tall in perfect form a long, long time ago believe it or not. At least, that's what I heard.\r\nWanderer Wryn: People's homes, work, places of fun and memories. They serve a different purpose now, and for that I'm thankful.\r\n[title=rabbit_8_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 9 sofa sleeping\r\n[title=rabbit_9_begin]\r\nNapping Wanderer: Z... grbbh... z...\r\n(Looks like they're napping on the old sand-ridden sofa. Better leave them be.)\r\nNapping Wanderer: Z... treasure... hmmgh... chest... z... they can't... have it... z...\r\n[title=rabbit_9_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 10 strider owner\r\n[title=rabbit_10_begin]\r\nTrainer Val: Whoa, easy now! The <color=#fcbe2b><b>striders</b></color> spook easily. Hard enough keepin' 'em wrangled up in one spot.\r\nTrainer Val: These three just got back from a dune run and are pretty exhausted.\r\nTrainer Val: Check back in a little while if you're interested in taking one out for a spin.\r\n[title=rabbit_10_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit Dusty\r\n[title=rabbit_dusty_0_begin]\r\nDusty: Hmm? You look new around here. How can I tell? You don't have any sand in your ears!\r\nDusty: I'm <color=#fcbe2b><b>Dusty</b></color>, I guess I run this pit of a village you're standing in. Used to be pretty nice, I'll tell you.\r\nDusty: This was all on a comfy little mesa up until a massive collapse awhile back. Now we've settled into this quicksand canyon.\r\nDusty: Anyways... you look like an eager explorer, so I'll give you some insider news. These weird spots around the desert have started popping up, right...\r\nDusty: If you're feeling up to it, borrow one of our striders and see if you can't help with the expedition.\r\nDusty: One of our explorers made some headway recently, check with them. Name's <color=#fcbe2b><b>Skuzzy</b></color>. I last saw him out standing by a little plateau.\r\nDusty: Better grab yourself a <color=yellow>strider</color> over there. Should help getting up places you can't reach on foot.\r\n[title=rabbit_dusty_0_end]\r\n\r\nMID QUEST (ROUND 2)\r\n\r\nRabbit Dusty repeat\r\n[title=rabbit_dusty_0_repeat_begin]\r\nDusty: One of our explorers made some headway recently, check with them. Name's <color=#fcbe2b><b>Skuzzy</b></color>; he's out by the little plateau nearby.\r\nDusty: Better grab yourself a <color=yellow>strider</color> over there. Some spots are hard to reach without one.\r\n[title=rabbit_dusty_0_repeat_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 10 strider owner\r\n[title=rabbit_10_1_begin]\r\nTrainer Val: Heard you were heading out to help with the expedition. You'll need a <color=yellow>strider</color> then.\r\nTrainer Val: Lucky for you one of 'em just got to feelin' up to a little fresh air. Go on then, hop on and get goin'!\r\n[title=rabbit_10_1_end]\r\n\r\nStrider 1\r\n[title=strider_0_begin]\r\nA desert <color=yellow>strider</color>. It looks like it could go pretty fast.\r\nStrider: Waawk!\r\n[question=1]Will you hop on and ride the bird?\r\n[choice]Yes.[newtalk start=strider_0_yes_begin break=strider_0_yes_end]\r\n[choice]No.[newtalk start=strider_0_no_begin break=strider_0_no_end]\r\n[title=strider_0_end]\r\n\r\nStider 1 choice yes\r\n[title=strider_0_yes_begin]\r\nYou carefully saddle yourself onto the bird.[event=0]\r\n[title=strider_0_yes_end]\r\n\r\nStrider 1 choice no\r\n[title=strider_0_no_begin]\r\nOn second thought, maybe later...\r\n[title=strider_0_no_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 0 intro\r\n[title=rabbit_0_1_begin]\r\nWanderer Renzo: Whoa, *cough cough* - look at you! Got yourself one of our striders, I see. Nice.\r\nWanderer Renzo: Poor <color=#fcbe2b><b>Skuzzy</b></color> left camp earlier thinking he wouldn't need one. Think he was heading for the little plateau nearby.\r\n[title=rabbit_0_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 1 lying on sofa solo\r\n[title=rabbit_1_1_begin]\r\nWanderer Fruz: Mhmm... yes? I'm trying to enjoy this shade alone, thanks.\r\n(They ignore you.)\r\n[title=rabbit_1_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 5 Swimmer\r\n[title=rabbit_5_1_begin]\r\nSwimmer Garf: *gluhgh gluggh*\r\n[title=rabbit_5_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 6 waterside\r\n[title=rabbit_6_1_begin]\r\nWanderer Truffle: Decided to help with our expedition after all? I guess I should get back to checking out these ruins too. Ugh.\r\n[title=rabbit_6_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 7 sofa sitting\r\n[title=rabbit_7_1_begin]\r\nWanderer Haden: Haven't seen any mystical figures or shapes out on the dunes lately. Think my mind's been preoccupied on those ruins.\r\nWanderer Haden: Could be the heat too. Wish it would all just go away and things would cool down a bit. Maybe one day.\r\n[title=rabbit_7_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 8 standing corner\r\n[title=rabbit_8_1_begin]\r\nWanderer Wryn: You checked out any of those ruins that popped up recently? They just rose out of the ground one day.\r\nWanderer Wryn: Shook the whole desert... caused a lot of the sand to rise a bit in places. Wonder if there's something inside.\r\n[title=rabbit_8_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 9 sofa sleeping\r\n[title=rabbit_9_1_begin]\r\nNapping Wanderer: Z... grbbh... z...\r\n(Still sleeping you guess.)\r\nNapping Wanderer: Z... that... treasure... z...\r\n[title=rabbit_9_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 3 Plateau Skuzzy\r\n[title=rabbit_3_1_begin]\r\nSkuzzy: H-hey! That looks like the <color=yellow>strider</color> I left back at camp! Stupid of me to have come all the way out here without it.\r\nSkuzzy: Well, you look like you're getting more use out of it than me right now. You should hop up top and check out this plateau.\r\n[title=rabbit_3_1_end]\r\n\r\nMonolith plateau\r\n[title=monolith_0_begin]\r\nCommand recognized. Processing central column... now active. Awaiting confirmation of surrounding columns.\r\nColumn activation order - <color=#dcff2b>YELLOW</color> - <color=#c654ff>PURPLE</color> - <color=#5479ff>BLUE</color>\r\nClosest forcefield will now deactivate when approached. Logging off.\r\n[title=monolith_0_end]\r\n\r\nMID QUEST 2\r\n\r\nRabbit 3 Plateau Skuzzy\r\n[title=rabbit_3_2_begin]\r\nSkuzzy: I heard some rumbling up there. Hope you didn't uncover any weird alien artifact or something.\r\nSkuzzy: This sandbox has been through enough already! If you're keen on exploring more, report any findings back to Dusty.\r\n[title=rabbit_3_2_end]\r\n\r\nMonolith yellow\r\n[title=monolith_1_begin]\r\nCommand recognized.

Awaiting final confirmation at energy source.\r\n[title=monolith_3_end]\r\n\r\nPOST QUEST (round 3)\r\n\r\nRabbit Dusty\r\n[title=rabbit_dusty_1_begin]\r\nDusty: I see you've been busy out in the dunes. You've uncovered more of those ruins than my entire village combined!\r\nDusty: Go and drop that <color=yellow>strider</color> off then come back and we'll talk more deeply about all of this.\r\n[title=rabbit_dusty_1_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 10 strider owner\r\n[title=rabbit_10_2_begin]\r\nTrainer Val: Something crazy is going down... could it have been the result of those ruins?\r\nTrainer Val: [question=2]Did you want to drop that <color=yellow>strider</color> off?\r\n[choice]Yea.[newtalk start=rabbit_10_2_yes_begin break=rabbit_10_2_yes_end]\r\n[choice]Nope.[newtalk start=rabbit_10_2_no_begin break=rabbit_10_2_no_end]\r\n[title=rabbit_10_2_end]\r\n\r\nTrainer choice yes\r\n[title=rabbit_10_2_yes_begin]\r\nYou dismount the bird carefully.[event=1]\r\n[title=rabbit_10_2_yes_end]\r\n\r\nTrainer choice no\r\n[title=rabbit_10_2_no_begin]\r\nTrainer Val: No? Alright then, you can keep it for a little longer if you want.\r\n[title=rabbit_10_2_no_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit Dusty\r\n[title=rabbit_dusty_2_begin]\r\nDusty: Glad to see you made it back.[event=2]\r\nDusty: Just before you returned, the visage of <color=#fcbe2b><b>three monoliths</b></color> appeared above the center of camp! Wait a second...\r\nDusty: ...do you feel that? Is it just me or has a bit of a breeze picked up out of nowhere?\r\nDusty: What is this... this <i>chill</i> I'm feeling? A sudden flurry of snow has started falling from the sky.\r\nDusty: Everything is changing so quickly. This all just started happening as soon as those columns were unearthed.\r\nDusty: We've lived in this desert for many, many years, and during that time we've lost so much. But we've learned to adapt to our situation.\r\nDusty: Now, as we stand in this collapsed chasm, I look up at something I see as a sign for a better, more promising future.\r\nDusty: Thanks for helping us. I know you're a wanderer just like we are, so I expect you still have a long journey ahead of you too.\r\nDusty: You're probably raring to get back to it, so we won't keep you any longer. If we ever meet again, I hope it's in a new world.\r\n[title=rabbit_dusty_2_end]\r\n\r\nRabbit 10 strider owner\r\n[title=rabbit_10_11_begin]\r\nTrainer Val: Leaving us so soon? That's too bad. Looks like we're going to have to start dressing warmer...\r\nTrainer Val: Say, why don't you take the <color=yellow>strider</color> for one last spin? Feel free to give 'er another go if you like!\r\n[title=rabbit_10_11_end]\r\n\r\nStrider 1\r\n[title=strider_00_begin]\r\nStrider: Waawk!\r\n[question=11]Will you hop on and ride the <color=yellow>strider</color>?\r\n[choice]Yes.[newtalk start=strider_00_yes_begin break=strider_00_yes_end]\r\n[choice]No.[newtalk start=strider_00_no_begin break=strider_00_no_end]\r\n[title=strider_00_end]\r\n\r\nStider 1 choice yes\r\n[title=strider_00_yes_begin]\r\nYou carefully saddle yourself onto the bird.[event=3]\r\n[title=strider_00_yes_end]\r\n\r\nStrider 1 choice no\r\n[title=strider_00_no_begin]\r\nOn second thought, maybe later...\r\n[title=strider_00_no_end]\r\n\r\nTreasure Chest\r\n[title=chest_0_begin]\r\nThere's what looks to be an abandoned chest buried halfway in the sand. It's a little familiar...\r\nStrangely enough, the lid's not shut all the way. You might be able to lift it up if you try.\r\n[question=111]Try lifting the lid of the chest?\r\n[choice]Sure?[newtalk start=chest_yes_begin break=chest_yes_end]\r\n[choice]Maybe not.[newtalk start=chest_no_begin break=chest_no_end]\r\n[title=chest_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=chest_yes_begin]\r\nDespite its heft, you manage to lift the chest's lid.[event=4]\r\nAn <color=#fcbe2b><b>old sandy key</b></color> was found inside. You're not sure what it might go to, but might as well take it with you.[event=5]\r\n[title=chest_yes_end]\r\n\r\n[title=chest_no_begin]\r\nYou decide not to mess with the chest. It may belong to someone.\r\n[title=chest_no_end]\r\n\r\n[title=lockeddoor_0_begin]\r\nAn old slab of concrete painted to look like a wooden door is blocking the way into the building.\r\nIt's sturdy and sealed tight. There might be a way to unlock it, but where could the key be, you wonder?\r\n[title=lockeddoor_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=lockeddoor_1_begin]\r\nYou use the <color=#fcbe2b><b>old sandy key</b></color> you found on the door.\r\n[title=lockeddoor_1_end]"
