But I think I saw an even <color=#03cffc><b>shinier</b></color> one somewhere up ahead!\r\n"Gogi": You should go and check it out!

We'll BOTH get the boot, or worse... docked pay.\r\nWorker Scroblin: If you need somethin' to do, go find the Foreman. She's probably skulking around here somewhere.\r\n[title=Scroblin_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=pickaxe_0_begin]\r\nThere's an old <color=yellow><b>Pickaxe</b></color> here. The name "Gibb" is etched into the metal surface. \r\nIt's probably best you don't take something that doesn't belong to you, so you leave it there.\r\n[title=pickaxe_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=pickaxe_00_begin]\r\nLooks like Gibb's <color=yellow>Pickaxe</color>. This may be useful for certain things.\r\nIt's possible he'd let you borrow it if you went and asked him.\r\n[title=pickaxe_00_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Stegz_0_begin]\r\nWorker Stegz: Got word that one of our sages went down there and somehow got themselves trapped.\r\nWorker Stegz: Total buffoon! Guessin' they shook some of the looser rocks free and created a cave-in too.\r\nWorker Stegz: I'm gonna need an expert chiseler, pronto! Dag-nabbit, where is <color=#fcbe2b>Gibb</color> at?!\r\n[title=Stegz_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=rockwall_0_begin]\r\nA big mass of jagged, crumbling boulders.

Get back to work or so help me!\r\nOverseer Og: Foreman Fran's put me in charge of watching you lazy bums, and I'm not giving you an INCH!\r\nOverseer Og: I've got lunch in a half-hour so put your backs into it! If I see even one of you slacking off...\r\n[title=Og_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=worker0_0_begin]\r\nWorker: Can't you see I'm busy? Go bug someone else!\r\n[title=worker0_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=worker1_0_begin]\r\nWorker: I've been chiseling nonstop for 11 hours now. Even just a couple minutes break would be absolute heaven.\r\n[title=worker1_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=worker2_0_begin]\r\nWorker: Foreman says she spotted some weird <color=#03cffc><b>relic</b></color> high up on that island, but we can't reach it so the heck with it.\r\n[title=worker2_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=worker3_0_begin]\r\nWorker: This job sucks, but every generation of my family has worked here.

Guy can't even get a little micro-nap for crying out loud.\r\nLazy Gibb: What's even the big deal? I'd say on any given day I do about 15 minutes of real, actual work.\r\nLazy Gibb: It's not that I'm lazy... it's just that I don't really care! But whatever, judge me how you want.\r\nLazy Gibb: That damn foreman's had her head so far up her own butt ever since that <color=#03cffc><b>relic</b></color> appeared. She doesn't even care about the crystal hauls anymore.\r\nLazy Gibb: If you wanna go and talk to her, she's on the ridge up ahead. Better hope she's in a good mood, pal. \r\n[title=Gibb_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Gibb_11_begin]\r\nLazy Gibb: You still hanging around?

It's claimed and locked tight under my ownership as of now!\r\nForeman Fran: [question=00]As for you- I'm in a decent mood so I'll let you take a guess at what I'm gonna have you do about it!\r\n[choice]Take a break?[newtalk start=answer0_Fran_begin break=answer0_Fran_end]\r\n[choice]Go home?[newtalk start=answer1_Fran_begin break=answer1_Fran_end]\r\n[choice]Get it for you...[newtalk start=answer2_Fran_begin break=answer2_Fran_end]\r\n[title=Fran_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Fran_01_begin]\r\nForeman Fran: [question=01]Guess again, punk!\r\n[choice]Take a break?[newtalk start=answer0_Fran_begin break=answer0_Fran_end]\r\n[choice]Go home?[newtalk start=answer1_Fran_begin break=answer1_Fran_end]\r\n[choice]Get it for you...[newtalk start=answer2_Fran_begin break=answer2_Fran_end]\r\n[title=Fran_01_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer0_Fran_begin]\r\nForeman Fran: HAHA!

There's a catch though... the only way across is with some good old-fashioned cave magic.\r\nForeman Fran: But my unreliable cave sage <color=#fcbe2b><b>Bernard</b></color> is nowhere to be found. Probably off snoozing somewhere in the deep mine, as usual.\r\nForeman Fran: Go and find him, and tell him to get his butt over here so he can create some kinda bridge to the <color=#03cffc><b>relic</b></color>!\r\nForeman Fran: Get to it then- <b>MOVE IT!</b>\r\n[title=answer2_Fran_end]\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nPOST-QUEST:\r\n\r\n[title=Fran_1_begin]\r\nForeman Fran: What are you still doing here?!

Maybe one of the other <b>lazy</b> workers knows something!\r\n[title=Fran_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Gibb_2_begin]\r\nLazy Gibb: She told you to go do what now? Ah, typical Foreman Fran. Always delegating the most pointless of tasks to her underlings.\r\nLazy Gibb: Look, man... life's too short to be running around licking boots all the time. But hey, you do you.\r\nLazy Gibb: As for me, I got too much self-respect to be down here any longer. So I'm giving up the mining career for good.\r\nLazy Gibb: If you're adamant on rolling with the foreman's punches, feel free to take my pickaxe. I left it... somewhere around here.\r\nLazy Gibb: Have a good time, sucker.\r\n[title=Gibb_2_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Stegz_Pickaxe_begin]\r\nWorker Stegz: Dagnabbit, <color=#fcbe2b><b>Gibb</b></color>!

What do I get for it? Nada.\r\nOverseer Og: [question=01]Pfft, whatever. Seems like she's gonna cash in the minute she gets ahold of it. Lucky wench. I mean... good for her.\r\n[choice]You're better.

That oversized ogre will get what's coming to her soon I bet...\r\nOverseer Og: Then I'll take over! I'd wager I could change things up around here and make a real BANG with the daily crystal hauls. It's all coming together![event=9]\r\n[title=answer_1_og_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_2_og_begin]\r\nOverseer Og: W-wait, what? What do you even know? You're just some no-name peon. If I didn't have my hands full I'd teach you a thing or two!\r\nOverseer Og: Get outta my face, kid! Everyone's a critic these days... can't catch a break to save my life.[event=8]\r\n[title=answer_2_og_end]\r\n\r\n[title=og_bad_begin]\r\nOverseer Og: Buzz off, kid! I got better things to do than waste my time talking to you.\r\n[title=og_bad_end]\r\n\r\n[title=og_good_begin]\r\nOverseer Og: You ain't too shabby, kid. I'll remember that next time. Now get back to work before I change my mind.\r\n[title=og_good_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Scroblin_1_begin]\r\nWorker Scroblin: Whew. Might sneak a short break in soon. These pickaxes are heavier than they look.\r\nWorker Scroblin: [question=00]Whaddya say we grab a drink after our shift ends?\r\n[choice]Sounds choice.[newtalk start=answer_1_scroblin_begin break=answer_1_scroblin_end]\r\n[choice]Sounds lame.[newtalk start=answer_2_scroblin_begin break=answer_2_scroblin_end]\r\n[title=Scroblin_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_1_scroblin_begin]\r\nWorker Scroblin: Now that's what I like to hear. I pitch that offer all the time and you're the first to accept it.\r\nWorker Scroblin: I don't care what the foreman says about you. You're alright in my book, kid.[event=11]\r\n[title=answer_1_scroblin_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_2_scroblin_begin]\r\nWorker Scroblin: Pfft. No need to get sleazy on me. You won't last long down here with an attitude like that.\r\nWorker Scroblin: I don't mind minimum pay but if my co-workers suck it's a lot worse. Forget about it, I'll bother someone else later.[event=10]\r\n[title=answer_2_scroblin_end]\r\n\r\n[title=scroblin_bad_begin]\r\nWorker Scroblin: !@#$%&' greedy sleazeball...\r\n[title=scroblin_bad_end]\r\n\r\n[title=scroblin_good_begin]\r\nWorker Scroblin: Right on! Only a few or so hours left and we're out of here.\r\n[title=scroblin_good_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Stegz_1_begin]\r\nWorker Stegz: Hey, where'd you get that axe from? Looks a lot like Gibb's. Well, he was supposed to dig this rubble out, but I guess you'll do.\r\nWorker Stegz: Alright then... go 'head and give that pile of rocks over there a good WHACK and hope they break loose. I'll just be back here...\r\n[title=Stegz_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=rockwall_1_begin]\r\nHoisting the heavy pickaxe over your shoulder, you bring yourself into a steady swinging stance. The thing is heavier than it looks.[event=2]\r\n...and <i>BIG SWING!</i>\r\nThe rock wall never stood a chance. But, to no surprise, neither did your rusty pickaxe. Great...\r\nOh well. You should at least be able to ride the service cart down into the shaft now.\r\n[title=rockwall_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Stegz_2_begin]\r\nWorker Stegz: Eh, I've seen better. Could've at least broke 'em up cleaner. Guess I'll go update the foreman now.\r\nWorker Stegz: Don't you go wanderin' 'round in the deep mine now. Whoever's down there ain't worth botherin' over.\r\n[title=Stegz_2_end]\r\n\r\n[title=minecart_go_begin]\r\n[question=1]An old minecart is sitting here.

Sounds like it's about to fall apart... [event=1]\r\n[title=answer_yes_minecart_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_no_minecart_begin]\r\nYou leave the cart alone.\r\n[title=answer_no_minecart_end]\r\n\r\n[title=minecart_broken_begin]\r\nThis old dilapidated rust bucket will no longer move. Thank you for your service, faithful minecart.\r\n[title=minecart_broken_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Bernard_1_begin]\r\nSage Bernard: Well, hello there! Don't these crystals radiate with the most hypnotic glow? I find myself just staring at them sometimes.\r\nSage Bernard: [question=2]So what brings you down here? Did you come all this way to avoid that crazed lunatic of a foreman too?\r\n[choice]To admire the rocks.[newtalk start=answer_sage_1_begin break=answer_sage_1_end]\r\n[choice]Need your magic![newtalk start=answer_sage_0_begin break=answer_sage_0_end]\r\n[title=Bernard_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_sage_1_begin]\r\nSage Bernard: Yes, they do have quite the sparkle to them this time of year, don't they? Not as sparkly as that weird <color=#03cffc><b>relic</b></color> up top, but still.\r\nSage Bernard: Feel free to join me and let your worries melt away. You know, because of the lava and all.[event=4]\r\n[title=answer_sage_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=Bernard_repeat_begin]\r\nSage Bernard: [question=3]Hmm? Anything else I can help you with? Excluding anything to do with the foreman, of course.\r\n[choice]Cool rocks![newtalk start=answer_sage_1_begin break=answer_sage_1_end]\r\n[choice]The foreman...[newtalk start=answer_sage_0_begin break=answer_sage_0_end]\r\n[title=Bernard_repeat_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_sage_0_begin]\r\nSage Bernard: Uugh. Foreman Fran needs me back up top, doesn't she? Guessing it's for that tantalizing shard of something or other.\r\nSage Bernard: I can guarantee handing that over to the foreman will only spell disaster. They don't call me a sage for nothing, that shard is trouble.\r\nSage Bernard: [question=4]I'm an old man and very tired nowadays. I have no desire to continue helping that lumbering maniac.

[newtalk start=answer_sage_no_begin break=answer_sage_no_end]\r\n[title=answer_sage_0_repeat_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_sage_yes_begin]\r\nSage Bernard: Unless... you grab the shard before her, of course! Take it with you, escape this damp, disgusting cavern, and never return.\r\nSage Bernard: Sound like a deal? Great! I want Fran to learn a bit of a lesson here. She can't just claim everything she lays her eye on.\r\nSage Bernard: I've been around awhile and if there's one thing I've picked up on, it's that you gotta earn things! Put the hard work in!\r\nSage Bernard: Fran acting so entitled to everything around her gives me the headache of a lifetime, so this'll be a nice change of pace.\r\nSage Bernard: Anyways! I think it's settled. I'll see you back there, then. Do mind that hot stuff behind me on your way back, will you?[event=3]\r\n[title=answer_sage_yes_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_sage_no_begin]\r\nSage Bernard: Thank you, thank you... I will!

But just know that handing it over to the foreman is quite the rotten idea.)\r\nSage Bernard: (Hmph. Maybe I'll finally settle down and retire after all these weird shenanigans. My old bones need a well deserved rest.)[event=6]\r\nForeman Fran: Get ON with the bridge magic, Bernard! I don't have all day, old man![event=7]\r\nSage Bernard: A-ahem, y-yes! Oh, magic platforms!

Anyway... back to other things...\r\nSage Bernard: Foreman Fran still needs me up there for getting that nasty little <color=#03cffc><b>relic</b></color> down. Remember our agreement, right?\r\nSage Bernard: Okay then, it's settled. I'll see you back there, then. Do try not to fall back into the hot stuff again, will you?
