Forgive me, my memory is not so good anymore.\r\nWater God Althos: At one point, long ago... there was a fragment of something or other that materialized here. Broken and not whole.\r\nWater God Althos: It has since been reclaimed by nature, the essence melted away into our very waters.\r\nWater God Althos: If it's what you're here for, you may have trouble finding it in a tangible form... but not all hope is lost.[newtalk start=god_1_repeat_begin break=god_1_repeat_end]\r\n[title=answer_god_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_god_1_begin]\r\nWater God Althos: Hmm. Advice! Many before you have requested this same thing, and always I give what I believe to be the purest example.\r\nWater God Althos: You see, in this world there are times you'll experience forces that exist only to keep you in one spot. Keep you from making any progress.\r\nWater God Althos: In reality, these forces are a product of your own creation. Your own personal road-block. They only exist as long as you allow them to.\r\nWater God Althos: Stand above them, convince yourself they're but a temporary obstacle. Treat hardships like water, and you will always find a way to pass through from one side, to the next.[newtalk start=god_1_repeat_begin break=god_1_repeat_end]\r\n[title=answer_god_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_god_2_begin]\r\nWater God Althos: Oh, of course, of course. Sometimes we wander aimlessly and simply need someone else to give us a bit of direction!\r\nWater God Althos: The essence of the fragment you seek is here, living in our waters. To the east and west lie our sacred reflection pools.\r\nWater God Althos: Travel to each and gather a vial of the waters. The seers that you will meet there may wish to speak with you beforehand.\r\nWater God Althos: They've probably had the gates locked for some time now, however. If <color=#fcbe2b><b>Treasurer Silus</b></color> is around, he may have an idea how to unlock them.\r\nWater God Althos: Once you have acquired the vials of each color, return to me.

Can I assist you in some way?\r\nTreasurer Silus: The essense of the pool spoke to you, I see! That is marvelous. You must go and tell the seers immediately.\r\nTreasurer Silus: Look to the green pool of the west courtyard. The seer there will guide you. Take this <color=#3aeb34><b>Green Gate Key</b></color> and pay them a visit.\r\nTreasurer Silus: Oh! And if you have time, humbly visit our four colorful deities and you will receive from each a blessing.

But, you are not from our world so the water is purely a figment of your imagination.\r\nGreen Seer Griss: The water must trust you first in order for you to take it with you.

A <b>home</b> is something that should put you at ease, settle your mind, and inspire unity.\r\nGreen Seer Griss: Please, go up and accept a vial of green water from the pool next to you. Once you have done so, speak with me again.\r\n[title=answer_green_seer_2_end]\r\n\r\n[title=green_seer_leave_begin]\r\nGreen Seer Griss: You've gathered the water and must now travel towards the east, to the red cleansing pools.\r\nGreen Seer Griss: Take with you this <color=#e33424><b>Red Gate Key</b></color>.

Very good... your assertiveness is somewhat commendable. I mistook you as someone to have so little spirit.\r\nRed Seer Rehmuss: Hmm, yes. I'll allow you to use my pool, just this once. However I wish to test your perception a bit further.\r\nRed Seer Rehmuss: [question=10]Tell me, what does someone gain from standing their ground?\r\n[choice]Nothing.[newtalk start=answer_red_seer_2_begin break=answer_red_seer_2_end]\r\n[choice]Self satisfaction.[newtalk start=answer_red_seer_3_begin break=answer_red_seer_3_end]\r\n[choice]Character.[newtalk start=answer_red_seer_4_begin break=answer_red_seer_4_end]\r\n[title=answer_red_seer_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=repeat_red_seer_0_begin]\r\nRed Seer Rehmuss: Hmph.

You must be daft... Is your mind wandering in the mist right now?\r\nRed Seer Rehmuss: How would that explain my position?

But anyone capable of rational thought can easily conceive that this is merely a temporary gain.\r\nRed Seer Rehmuss: A longer term attribute is much more desireable and worthy to be called a reward than something as dull as that.[newtalk start=repeat_red_seer_0_begin break=repeat_red_seer_0_end]\r\n[title=answer_red_seer_3_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_red_seer_4_begin]\r\nRed Seer Rehmuss: Very astute. <b>Character</b> is what separates us from the droves of our other rival primitives.
