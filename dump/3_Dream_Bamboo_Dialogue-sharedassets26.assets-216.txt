I never had a single doubt about you. We must talk about the expedition.\r\nMayor Morel: You look rather tired, so I won't keep you long! Tell me, did you manage to find what you were looking for?\r\nMayor Morel: [question=6]Aha, I knew you'd be back with something interesting. That pyramid ended up having quite the treasure!\r\n[choice]Can you fix it?[newtalk start=answer_mayor_1_begin break=answer_mayor_1_end]\r\n[choice]What is it?[newtalk start=answer_mayor_11_begin break=answer_mayor_11_end]\r\n[title=mayor_2_end]\r\n\r\n[title=answer_mayor_11_begin]\r\nMayor Morel: Looks like a fractured shard of something. Something big and probably very important!\r\nMayor Morel: If anything, I'd put my money on it being part of that <color=#03cffc><b>dream shard</b></color> nonsense you were spouting earlier.\r\nMayor Morel: Regardless, a little elbow grease and I might be able to give back some of its old glow.[newtalk start=mayor_22_begin break=mayor_22_end]\r\n[title=answer_mayor_11_end]\r\n\r\n[title=mayor_22_begin]\r\nMayor Morel: [question=7]Whatever it is, I get the strongest sense that it doesn't belong here.

This is an ancient relic, after all. Dating back farther than perhaps time itself.[event=2]\r\nMayor Morel: But I'll give it a shot! My, to think this was just on the outside of our village, sitting there for who knows how long.\r\nMayor Morel: Give me a minute now... my restoration magic's a little rusty. Hopefully this'll spark a little bit of its life back.\r\nMayor Morel: There we go, good as new. You see? Even the most broken and forgotten trinkets can be renewed with a little care. Keep it close.\r\nMayor Morel: Please take good care of the shard while you continue on your journey, but most importantly, take good care of yourself.\r\nMayor Morel: Farewell, youngster!\r\n[title=answer_mayor_1_end]\r\n\r\n[title=kidrun_0_begin]\r\nToadstool Tommy: This way! This way! Behind the house! Let's go exploring!\r\n[title=kidrun_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=mountain_begin]\r\nAs you stand along the sheer cliff edge, you take a deep breath and peer along the golden horizon.\r\nA fresh smell of crisp mountain air gently fills your lungs. You feel calm. At ease. Relaxed.\r\nYou feel like you could stay here forever, but remember you must return to the task at hand.\r\n[title=mountain_end]\r\n\r\n[title=door_close_begin]\r\nWeird Door: Kekeke... and don't come back...! \\n<i>(Geez, I'm never opening my door for any of these weirdos again...)</i>\r\n[title=door_close_end]\r\n\r\n[title=secret_0_begin]\r\n(He's too busy jamming to notice you.)\r\n[title=secret_0_end]\r\n\r\n[title=gardener_scared_begin]\r\nGardener Freckle: [jitter=5 angle=0]G-gAAH...![/jitter] Crimini!
