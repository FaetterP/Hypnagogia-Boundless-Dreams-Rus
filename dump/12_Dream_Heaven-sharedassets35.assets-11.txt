But we can reach it, together.\r\nEveryone is waiting for us. They've been waiting for longer than we can imagine. We shouldn't keep them.\r\nCome on. It's just across the way. We'll go together, so we're not afraid.\r\n[title=you_end]\r\n\r\n[title=oldman_begin]\r\nI hope you took something from all this. It'd be quite silly if you came all this way and didn't learn anything!\r\nBut I don't believe that. I knew from the second I saw you that you'd do great things. You have more patience than I ever did.\r\nWhen you get to be as old as I am, you learn to appreciate things other people tend to rush through. Take your time, now!\r\n[title=oldman_end]\r\n\r\n[title=snake_begin]\r\nI was quick to judge you at first, but you've made me realize how little I actually knew about you. How much more you're capable of.\r\nAt first I believed I was the teacher, the one to own all the knowledge. But you've taught me to be more thoughtful of others, and for that I'm thankful.\r\nLet the calming waters of old and new wash around you with soothing acceptance, as they did me and others before me. Thank you.\r\n[title=snake_end]\r\n\r\n[title=mushroom_begin]\r\nStill whipping and snapping, as always I see! Something tells me you've got the mark of a real go-getter on you. Reminds me of younger me!\r\nDon't let me get you all worked up though. Sometimes even lost and broken things need a bit of sentimental appreciation.\r\nYou've gotta dig deep inside yourself, deeper than you ever have. We're all broken in some way, but we can all be fixed too.\r\n[title=mushroom_end]\r\n\r\n[title=ice_begin]\r\nI've forced myself to become cold and distant from so many people I love, just to protect myself. I was always afraid.\r\nYou being around folded over me like a warm blanket, a subtle comfort I've never experienced before. I know I can do better than this.\r\nIn a way you saved me from myself, and I can never repay that. I hope your presence continues to inspire others for a long time.\r\n[title=ice_end]\r\n\r\n[title=space_begin]\r\nIt's okay to live in your own world sometimes, even if it's made up like a maze of endless corridors. You're never truly lost.\r\nThere's time to stop and draw a map, make a solution, change course, reflect. You have all the time in the world to make a decision.\r\nThe universe is an infinite loop of chaotic madness that's all happening too slowly for us to worry so much about. Find comfort in that.\r\n[title=space_end]\r\n\r\n[title=king_begin]\r\nIt's so hard to know what it is I have to learn from all the mistakes I've made in my life. It feels like a physical obstacle I just can't traverse.\r\nMy heart hangs heavy with the notion I'll have made those mistakes forever, but you've taught me how to move on, to embrace them.\r\nI hope one day I can free myself. I hope one day I can give myself another chance. I'll rest until that day comes.\r\n[title=king_end]\r\n\r\n[title=rejected_begin]\r\nI've had a hard life, and I know others have it much worse than me. I've begged for so long to have someone shake us awake.\r\nHave our prayers been answered? Are you the one who will bring our lost and bitter views back into perspective?\r\nYou being around brings a much needed freshness to the air. A feeling that we'll remember for the rest of our days.\r\n[title=rejected_end]\r\n\r\n[title=child_begin]\r\nYou've been so nice to me, to everyone, even to yourself. You deserve so much more than you think you do. We all do.\r\nBut, what if it's all been a dream? Everything to happen in the world, our creations, our emotions, our connections.\r\nNo matter what happens, I'll never forget you. Promise you'll do the same for me. It's your time to wake up now.\r\n[title=child_end]"
